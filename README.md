# Episode I: The Rise of C-Meme-30

- Your Discord server is in trouble!

- The memes have poured into #general, and the ADMINS are losing hope.

- However, the balance of cringe is restored when C-Meme-30 is [dispatched to your server](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=641348914343051282&scope=bot&permissions=66078976).

- This droid can partake in this civil discussion when younglings preface their text command with the special character "/"

- What remains to be seen is if the council enjoys C-Meme-30 as much as my friends and I did...
